# BISI-CST2101-F23-Project
Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of diabetes within the Pima Indians tribe, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and building a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant features.

Background:
Diabetes is a prevalent global health issue, and its causes are believed to be a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. The Pima Indians, or Pima tribe, provide an interesting study population due to their susceptibility to diabetes, particularly among females at an early age. This project aims to explore various aspects of diabetes within this tribe, shedding light on potential contributing factors.

Data Source:
The data for this project is sourced from a study conducted on the Pima tribe in America. The dataset includes information on female individuals who are at least 21 years old and are of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset is subject to specific constraints to ensure relevance and reliability.

Methodology:

Data Collection:

Acquire the dataset from the Pima tribe study, ensuring it meets the specified constraints.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships among variables.
Visualize key features, such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), glucose levels, and other relevant parameters.
Identify patterns, outliers, and potential correlations.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data and outliers appropriately.
Normalize or scale features if necessary.
Encode categorical variables.
Feature Selection:

Identify key features that significantly contribute to the prediction of diabetes.
Consider feature engineering if needed.
Model Building:

Select a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
Fine-tune the model parameters if required.
Results and Interpretation:

Present the findings of the exploratory data analysis.
Discuss the performance and insights gained from the classification model.
Interpret the significance of key features in predicting diabetes.
Conclusion:
This project aims to contribute valuable insights into the factors associated with diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe. Through rigorous exploratory data analysis and the development of a classification model, we seek to enhance our understanding of diabetes within this specific population, potentially paving the way for targeted interventions and healthcare strategies.
